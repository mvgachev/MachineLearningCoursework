# MachineLearningCoursework

This assignment is about analysing use cases, designing machine learning algorithms and evaluating
the resulting design/implementation. This year's use case is based on the MediaEval 2015 "verifying
multimedia use" task

You will design and build a machine learning algorithm to classify posts within the MediaEval 2015
"verifying multimedia use" dataset. You will analyse the use case (task and data) and select where
needed pre-processing steps, feature selection methods, dimensionality reduction techniques and a
machine learning algorithm. You will train your implemented algorithm using the MediaEval 2015
"verifying multimedia use" training dataset provided. You will evaluate your implemented algorithm
by classifying posts in the MediaEval 2015 "verifying multimedia use" test dataset and scoring the
answers against the test set ground truth labels.

In addition you will write a final report. This will explain your use case analysis, justifying your choice
of pre-processing step(s), feature selection method(s), dimensionality reduction technique(s) and
machine learning algorithm. You will report your results using the MediaEval 2015 "verifying
multimedia use" evaluation metrics.
